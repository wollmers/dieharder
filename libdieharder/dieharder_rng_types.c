 *******************************************************************
 * This is being directly adapted from and modified for use in dieharder
 * so it can maintain its own independent RNG space of types not limited
 * by its internal limit of 100.  To avoid collisions, we'll start our number
 * space above 100, and extend it to 1000.
 *
 * While we're at it, let's define the ranges:
 *
 *   0-199 gsl generators (fixed order from now on with room for growth)
 *   200-399 libdieharder generators (fixed order from now on)
 *   400-499 R-based generators (fixed order from now on)
 *   500-599 hardware generators (e.g. /dev/random and friends)
 *   600-699 user-defined generators (starting with dieharder example)
 *   700-999 reserved for future integration with R-like environments
 *
 * Naturally, we can simply bump MAXRNGS and add more, but 1000 seems
 * likely to last for "a while" and maybe "forever".
